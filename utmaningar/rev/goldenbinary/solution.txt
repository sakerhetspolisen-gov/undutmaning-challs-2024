## Beskrivning
```
this chall is a simple file encoder thats using fibbonaci encoing and xor the input with the last output form the encoder.
the point is to reverse the echo binary, understand the encoder and program a decoder for the flag file (the flag file is a binary that prints the flag.).

folder: chall
    should contain everything needed for using the chall in a CTF
folder: info
    fibb.c
        is the soruce for the encoder (echo).
    fibb.py
        is a decoder for the stuff that echo puts out.
    flag.c 
        the source for flag.
```

## LÃ¶sning
`python3 src/fibb.py xordec flag`

## Flagga

Flaggan finns i `src/flag.c`
